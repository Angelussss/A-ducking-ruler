# PCB Ruler

Yes, it’s a **ruler**. On a **PCB**. Because why not?  

I wanted a custom ruler, so I opened KiCad, made one that’s **21 cm × 4 cm**, slapped on some extra nonsense, and now it’s open source.  
If you’ve ever looked at your desk and thought *“what if my measuring tool was also a PCB?”*, you’ve found your people.

## Features (a.k.a. excuses to make a PCB)

- **It measures stuff** — up to 20 cm! (metric gang rise up)
- **FR4** — because cardboard rulers are for cowards.
- **Two layers** — which is 100% overkill for a ruler.
- Random footprints for components you probably don’t need to solder onto your ruler.
- Track width samples, via holes, and other “PCB flex” you’ll show your friends once before they politely change the subject.
- Potentially doubles as a very, very bad heatsink.
- Makes your desk look 12% more “engineer-y.”

## Why?

Because I could.  
Also, because sometimes you want to measure things *and* flex your ability to design pointless PCBs.

## How to Use

1. Put it on your desk.  
2. Measure things.  
3. Realize it’s heavier than your old ruler but way cooler.  
4. Brag to your non-electronics friends, who will be impressed for approximately three seconds.

## Open Source

The KiCad project files are here so you can:
- Make your own ruler
- Modify it
- Add even more unnecessary features (blinky LEDs? Wi-Fi? A CPU??)

## License

Do whatever you want with it, just don’t sue me if you somehow injure yourself with a flat piece of fiberglass.
